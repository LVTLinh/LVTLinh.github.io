          <h1>Exfoliation:</h1>
          <p>Exfoliating your skin helps remove dead skin cells, unclog pores, and promote skin renewal. Exfoliation can be done with physical exfoliants (scrubs) or chemical exfoliants (products containing alpha hydroxy acids or beta hydroxy acids). However, it's important not to over-exfoliate, as this can irritate the skin.</p>
